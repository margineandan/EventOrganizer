# EventOrganizer
This project, developed in Python as my first-year university project, allowed me to gain hands-on experience with the language and familiarize myself with its core concepts.

## Functionalities

- **Person Management**: Add, update, delete, and search for person information.
- **Event Management**: Create, update, delete, and query events, including person-event relationships.
- **Event Participation**: Add/remove persons from events and view event participants.
- **Event and Person Filtering**: Filter and display events or persons based on different criteria such as description or date.
- **Statistics & Reporting**: Display top persons and events based on specific metrics and event participation.
- **User Interface**: Command-driven interface for interacting with the system and performing various operations efficiently.

The application is designed to showcase Python's ability to build modular, maintainable systems that handle data management and reporting with ease.
